# Advent-of-Code-2021
My solutions to the coding challenge during 2021 December, see the **[link](https://adventofcode.com/2021)** attached. Contents created using Google Colaboratory, as I find it really convenient for toy projects. Codes are well-commented, so basically any user could understand the solutions. Hope you enjoy!

Giving credit to u/azzal07 on Reddit for clarifying the problem on Day 18, **[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/uv691o/2021_day_18_part_1_python_example_of_steps/)**.
